Hence many attempts have been made accurately detect the bent knee and loss of contact during the event. Here we discuss a cost-effective method using graphical programming to accurately detect the loss of contact during the training sessions in university athletes. A piezo-electric sensor system in implemented together with NI-myRIO. We differentiated walking, running and race-walking patterns with the help of histograms of peak time differences between main peaks and sub-peaks.",
